### Hi, I'm Alice ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with 4 years of experience crafting delightful web experiences at the intersection of media and tech. You can find my work across well-known media companies such as The Atlantic and National Geographic.

At The Atlantic, I'm currently building sponsored landing pages with our Re:think team, and working on games ðŸ‘€
